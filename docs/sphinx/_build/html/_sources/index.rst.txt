Welcome to LightWeight AutoDiff 4 Neural Net!
==============================================================

This project has been created to with the following goals in mind:

 * Write code for people who are comfortable with object oriented programming and
   rely on well documented interfaces (including type information).
 * Write code that is clearer to understand for professional developers.
 * Make the code as simple as possible - try not to  look too clever. Clever "looking" code is almost always
   a sign of amateur coders. It is far easier to write clever code than simple, obvious and easy
   to understand code.
 * Make it easy for those who wish to learn to plug and play their modules without much work.


There is nothing wrong with contributing to pytoch and tensorflow but it may be too much if you
just starting out with deep learning.


You should start with the Nodes module.
