Welcome to LightWeight AutoDiff 4 Neural Net!
==============================================================
This project has been created to with the following goals:

 * Write code for people who are comfortable with object oriented programming and
   rely on well documented interfaces (including type information).
 * Write code that is clearer to understand for professional developers.
 * Make the code as simple as possible - try not to be look too clever. Clever "looking" code is almost always
   a sign of amateur coders. Clever code on the other hand is simple, obvious and easy
   to understand.
 * Write code that is explicit. I hate code like A@M+b where the coder makes all kinds of
   assumptions regarding the shapes.
 * Make it easy for those who wish to learn to plug and play their modules without much work.

You should start with the Nodes module.
